An ansible bug?

Given a role 'consumer' and which depends on another 'dep'.

Let consumer accept a boolean parameter, and pass it on to dep verbatim.

If dollar variables are used, all is well.

If moustaches are used, False is apparently converted to "False" and logic bites your arse.

This is a test case which replicates that.

Tested with:

    ansible-playbook 1.4 (devel f4b3defcbf) last updated 2013/09/16 10:55:26 (GMT +100)

Run with:

    ansible-playbook -vi test_hosts -c local -l localhost test.yml 

Output: see test.out
